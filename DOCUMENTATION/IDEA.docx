Hermes Might is a web based software solution where a user can rent playgrounds in different area in the city.
It allows users to look for playground where they can arrange sports tournaments,
can rent for play or they can find other people who want to play
and volunteers can help the distressed people in case of natural disaster or take part in other social activities.
